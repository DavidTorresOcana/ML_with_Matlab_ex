Challenges with multiple sports
We now introduce the option to create challenges with multiple different sports - so in this month’s cycling challenge it doesn’t matter if you track Mountain biking, Cycling Sport or Cycling Transport as it all counts in the challenge. You can also create your own challenge with up to 20 different sports.

This month's challenges are: 

 

Run! It’s fun!
Type: Miles - Running
Duration: October 1, 2012 - October 31, 2012
Prize: 3 Endomondo Running Jackets
Join Challenge!

 

The All Cycling Challenge
Type: Miles - Cycling Sport, Cycling Transport and Mountain Biking
Duration: October 3, 2012 - November 30, 2012
Prize: 3 Endomondo Cycling Tops
Join Challenge!

In all the challenges we conduct a drawing among all participants to find some prize winners, so everybody has a chance to win a prize. But the more miles/calories/workouts you track, the better your odds are.
