%  Instructions
%  ------------
%
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     pca.m
%     projectData.m
%     recoverData.m
%     computeCentroids.m
%     findClosestCentroids.m
%     kMeansInitCentroids.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% ================= Part 1: Find Closest Centroids ====================
%  To help you implement K-Means, we have divided the learning algorithm 
%  into two functions -- findClosestCentroids and computeCentroids. In this
%  part, you shoudl complete the code in the findClosestCentroids function. 
%
fprintf('Finding closest centroids.\n\n');

% Load an example dataset that we will be using
load('ex7data2.mat');

% Select an initial set of centroids
K = 3; % 3 Centroids
initial_centroids = [3 3; 6 2; 8 5];

% Find the closest centroids for the examples using the
% initial_centroids
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, initial_centroids);

fprintf('Closest centroids for the first 3 examples: \n')
fprintf(' %d', idx(1:3));
fprintf('\n(the closest centroids should be 1, 3, 2 respectively)\n');

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
% pause;

%% ===================== Part 2: Compute Means =========================
%  After implementing the closest centroids function, you should now
%  complete the computeCentroids function.
%
fprintf('\nComputing centroids means.\n\n');

%  Compute means based on the closest centroids found in the previous part.
centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K);

fprintf('Centroids computed after initial finding of closest centroids: \n')
fprintf(' %f %f \n' , centroids');
fprintf('\n(the centroids should be\n');
fprintf('   [ 2.428301 3.157924 ]\n');
fprintf('   [ 5.813503 2.633656 ]\n');
fprintf('   [ 7.119387 3.616684 ]\n\n');

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
% pause;


%% =================== Part 3: K-Means Clustering ======================
%  After you have completed the two functions computeCentroids and
%  findClosestCentroids, you have all the necessary pieces to run the
%  kMeans algorithm. In this part, you will run the K-Means algorithm on
%  the example dataset we have provided. 
%
fprintf('\nRunning K-Means clustering on example dataset.\n\n');

% Load an example dataset
load('ex7data2.mat');

% Settings for running K-Means
K = 3;
max_iters = 10;

% For consistency, here we set centroids to specific values
% but in practice you want to generate them automatically, such as by
% settings them to be random examples (as can be seen in
% kMeansInitCentroids).
initial_centroids = [3 3; 6 2; 8 5];

% Run K-Means algorithm. The 'true' at the end tells our function to plot
% the progress of K-Means
[centroids, idx] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters, true); % The last option is to enable the progres plot
fprintf('\nK-Means Done.\n\n');

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
% pause;



%% =============== Part 4: Doing it with Multiclassification of 3 classes ================
%  The following code will load the next dataset into your environment and 
%  plot the data. 
%

fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

% Construct he data set for SVM learning and ploting the Boundary
y=idx-1;
% Plot training data
plotData3Data(X, y);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;
%% ========== Part 5: Training SVM Multiclassification one_Vs_all ==========
%  After you have implemented the kernel, we can now use it to train the 
%  SVM classifier.
% 
fprintf('\nTraining SVM with RBF Kernel (this may take 1 to 2 minutes) ...\n');

% SVM Parameters
C = 1; sigma = 0.1;

% We set the tolerance and max_passes lower here so that the code will run
% faster. However, in practice, you will want to run the training to
% convergence.

for c=0:2 % Nº labels

model(1,c+1)= svmTrain(X, double(y == c) , C, @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma)); 

end
visualizeBoundary3Data(X, y , model(1,:),c);
fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;
